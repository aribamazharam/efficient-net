# Yoga Classifier

Welcome to the Yoga Classifier project! This project was created for testing and evaluating yoga poses. This classifier is designed to recognize and categorize different yoga poses.

## Project Overview

The Yoga Classifier is an AI-based system that uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to identify various yoga poses based on input images or videos. The project's core functionality lies in its ability to analyze the key features of different yoga postures and classify them into predefined categories, making it a valuable asset for yoga instructors, fitness centers, and wellness companies.

## Features

- **Accuracy**: The Yoga Classifier is trained on an extensive dataset, allowing it to achieve high accuracy in identifying yoga poses.
- **Customizability**: The project can be further trained on specific yoga poses or modified to suit unique requirements.

## Usage

**Classification**: The system will process the input and accurately identify the yoga pose from its trained categories.

## Improvements

**First Improvement**: The accuracy was 62%.

**Second Improvement**: The accuracy went to 69%, due to an increase in the number of epochs.

**Third Improvement**: The accuracy went to 86% again due to augmentation and another increase in the number of epochs.
